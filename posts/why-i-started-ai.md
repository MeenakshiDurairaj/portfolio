# Why I Started Learning AI

*April 23, 2025*

Artificial Intelligence is always a miracle for me and I looked at it as a magic like a child watching a magic show. When everyone talks about greatness of aritificial intelligence I always wondered what is so special about it. I was very keen to know about their technical stacks and techniques to handle millions of records in their search engine, recommendation apps, voice or image recognition.

## 🌟 What Inspired Me

One major turning point was realizing how AI is already a part of our daily lives — from voice assistants and smart cameras to chatbots and recommendation engines.

I thought: _"If I can understand how these systems work, maybe I can build something that helps people too."_

## 🛠️ What I'm Learning

So far, I've explored:

- Python programming
- Basic AI concepts like rule-based systems
- How to build simple chatbots (yes — like the one in this portfolio!)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring AI to the web

## 🚀 What's Next?

Next up, I'm planning to:

- Dive into machine learning and neural networks
- Work with images (computer vision!)
- Build smarter chatbots using natural language understanding

## 💬 Thanks for Reading!

If you're also curious about AI or just starting your journey, I’d love to connect.
