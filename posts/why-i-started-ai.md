# Why I Started Learning AI

*April 23, 2025*

Artificial Intelligence has always fascinated me. From the first time I interacted with Siri to reading about how machines can learn on their own, I knew I wanted to dive deeper into this world.

## 🌟 What Inspired Me

One major turning point was realizing how AI is already a part of our daily lives — from voice assistants and smart cameras to chatbots and recommendation engines.

I thought: _"If I can understand how these systems work, maybe I can build something that helps people too."_

## 🛠️ What I'm Learning

So far, I've explored:

- Python programming
- Basic AI concepts like rule-based systems
- How to build simple chatbots (yes — like the one in this portfolio!)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring AI to the web

## 🚀 What's Next?

Next up, I'm planning to:

- Dive into machine learning and neural networks
- Work with images (computer vision!)
- Build smarter chatbots using natural language understanding
