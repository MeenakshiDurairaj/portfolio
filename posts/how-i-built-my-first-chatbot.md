# How I Built My First Chatbot

*April 24, 2025*

---

Building my first chatbot was both exciting and a little intimidating. I started with a simple goal: create a bot that could have a basic conversation with a user.

## ðŸ§± My Starting Point

I used:

- Python (basic scripting)
- If-else statements (for logic)
- A loop to keep the conversation going

It wasnâ€™t fancy, but it worked â€” the bot could greet, respond to a few questions, and say goodbye.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How chatbots understand input (basic intent handling)
- Keeping responses flexible but structured
- The value of feedback from real users!

## ðŸš€ What's Next

I'm planning to:

- Add natural language understanding (maybe with spaCy or transformers!)
- Connect it to a web UI
- Let it learn new things from users

## ðŸ¤– Final Thoughts

Even a simple bot can feel like magic when it works. I learned that building AI doesnâ€™t need to be complicated â€” just consistent!
